# What is an API ?

---
class: center, middle

.center[![API](api.png)]

> “a publicly available web-based URL that returns data, likely in JSON or XML”

---

# What is an API ?

Two major use cases:

1. Users can send a request detailing the information they want.
2. Users can send a request alter data on the applications

---

# What is an API ?

#### Request

```
GET https://api.github.com/users/phpfour
```

#### Response

```json

# API-first Development

- Building the API first as a specification, using any of the below specification:

  - OpenAPI standard (OAS)
  - ReDoc

- Start early collaboration with API consumers, resulting in feedback

- Test run API through mocking tools

- API Consumers can carry on integration work while API development is ongoing

# REST API Basics

---

# REST API Basics

Let's first set the base:

- **Resource** is an object or representation of something, which has some associated data with it and there can be set of methods to operate on it.

    Example: _employee, user, blogpost, etc_

- **Collections** are set of resources, for example _**companies**_ is the collection of Company resource

- **URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** is a path through which a resource can be located and some actions can be performed on it.

    Example: `http://api.project.com/v1.0/users/1`

---
class: center, middle, inverse

# URL Structure

---

# URL Structure

- Resources should be **plural**, not singular

    Good:
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/users`
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/employees/1`

    Bad:
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/blogposts`
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/company/1`

    Only exception when it is guranteed to have one resource:

    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/me`

---

# URL Structure

- Use resource names (**nouns**), not _actions_ or _verbs_ in your URL

    Good:
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/users/1/messages`
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/employees/1/roles`

    Bad:
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/getCompanies/1`
    - `http://api.project.com/v1.0/users/1/sendMessage`

---

# HTTP Verbs

---

# HTTP Verbs

HTTP has defined few sets of methods which indicates the type of action to be performed on the resources

- **`GET`** - fetches one resource (or a collection of resouces), should not alter data or produce any side effect

  - `GET /v1.0/users/1`
  - `GET /v1.0/employees`
  - `GET /v1.0/companies/xyz/jobs`
  - `GET /v1.0/search/c4ca4238a0b923820dcc509a6f75849b/results`

- **`POST`** - create a resource, connect multiple resource, initiate a process etc

  - `POST /v1.0/users`
  - `POST /v1.0/employees/1/suspend`
  - `POST /v1.0/balance-transfer`

---

# HTTP Verbs

HTTP has defined few sets of methods which indicates the type of action to be performed on the resources

- **`PUT`** - update an entire resource, or create one if non-existant

  - `PUT /v1.0/users/1`
  - `PUT /v1.0/companies/xyz/jobs/senior-software-engineer`

- **`DELETE`** - delete a resource, and/or dependent sub-resources

  - `DELETE /v1.0/users/1`
  - `DELETE /v1.0/companies/xyz/jobs/senior-software-engineer/applicants`

---

# HTTP Verbs

HTTP has defined few sets of methods which indicates the type of action to be performed on the resources

- **`PATCH`** - partial update of a resource, requests contain only the diff

  - `PATCH /v1.0/users/1`

    ```json
    {
      "locked": true
    }
    ```

  - `PATCH /v1.0/companies/xyz/jobs/senior-software-engineer`

    ```json
    {
      "published": true,
      "publish_date": "2019-06-01 10:00:00"
    }
    ```

# Status Codes

---

# Status Codes

HTTP status codes are bunch of standardized codes for various scenarios. The server should always return the right status code.

- **2xx** (Success category)

  These status codes represent that the requested action was received and successfully processed by the server.

  - **200 OK**

      The standard HTTP response for success in GET, PUT or POST.

  - **201 Created**

      Should be returned whenever a new instance is created

  - **204 No Content**

      Request is successfully processed, but don't have any content (`DELETE`)

---

# Status Codes

HTTP status codes are bunch of standardized codes for various scenarios. The server should always return the right status code.

- **3xx** (Redirect category)

  - **301 Moved Permanently**

      Resource moved to a new location, link is included in the Location header

  - **304 Not Modified**

      Indicates that the client has the response already in its cache. And hence there is no need to transfer the same data again.

---

# Status Codes

HTTP status codes are bunch of standardized codes for various scenarios. The server should always return the right status code.

- **4xx** (Client Error Category)

  These status codes represent that the client has raised a faulty request.

  - **400 Bad Request**

      indicates that the request was not processed due to invalid data

  - **401 Unauthorized**

      indicates that the client is not allowed to access resources

  - **403 Forbidden**

      indicates that the request is valid and the client is authenticated, but the client is not allowed access resource due to permission

  - **404 Not Found**

      indicates that the requested resource is not found

---

# Status Codes

HTTP status codes are bunch of standardized codes for various scenarios. The server should always return the right status code.

- **5xx** (Server Error Category)

  - **500 Internal Server Error**

      indicates that the request is valid, but there is an error on server due to some unexpected condition

  - **503 Service Unavailable**

      indicates that the server is down or unavailable to receive and process the request

---

# Versioning

---

# Versioning

Helps maintain backward compatibility and also to provide new features side-by-side.

- **URL Prefix** - allow a safety valve for backwards incompatible resource changes

  - `GET /v1.0/users/1`
  - `GET /v2.0/users/profile`

- **Custom Header** - allows the URLs to be same, change in representation

  - `X-Version: 3.0`
  - `X-Version: 2018-01-06`

---

# Filtering

- *Discrete Data*

  - `GET /v1.0/users?role=supervisor`
  - `GET /v1.0/orders?shipped=true`
  - `GET /v1.0/orders?status=shipped&supplier=xyz`
  - `GET /v1.0/orders?filter[status]=shipped&filter[supplier]=xyz`

- *Continiuous Data*

  - `GET /v1.0/orders?start_date=2019-01-01&end_date=2019-03-01`
  - `GET /v1.0/orders?date[gte]=2019-01-01&date[lte]=2019-03-01`
  - `GET /v1.0/posts?since=2019-01-01`

---

# Sorting

- Separate param for field and order:

  - `GET /v1.0/posts?sort_by=publish_date&order_by=desc`
  - `GET /v1.0/jobs?sort_by=department&order_by=asc`

- Multiple param with field and order combined:

  - `GET /v1.0/posts?sort_by=publish_date.desc&sort_by=featured.asc`
  - `GET /v1.0/jobs?sort_by=department.asc&sort_by=title.asc`

- One param with field and orders combined:

  - `GET /v1.0/posts?sort_by=publish_date.desc,featured.asc`
  - `GET /v1.0/jobs?sort_by=department.asc,title.asc`

---

# Searching

- Keyword based global search, can match multiple fields:

  - `GET /v1.0/items?q=api`

- Field-specifc search:

  - `GET /v1.0/jobs?q=title:software+enginner,salary:[100K-150K]`

---
